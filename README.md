This repository contains the first homework assignment for the Open-Source Energy System Modelling course at TU Wien.

## Overview
The project includes three simple functions designed to perform basic geometric calculations:

- Triangle Surface Area – Calculates the surface area of a triangle.

- Circle Surface Area – Calculates the surface area of a circle.

- Cylinder Volume – Calculates the volume of a cylinder.

Additionally, a test function is provided to validate the correctness of the implemented calculations.
